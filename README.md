This project focuses on the development of an interactive Historical Facts and Trivia Chatbot, designed to enhance learning through conversational AI. The chatbot engages users by providing random historical facts, answering queries related to historical events and figures, and offering trivia quizzes to test users' knowledge. Utilizing natural language processing (NLP) and simple conversational logic, the bot allows users to interact in a natural, conversational style, offering an engaging and educational experience.
